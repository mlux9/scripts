# simple catalog

Based on [calibre2opds](https://calibre2opds.com/ "calibre2opds"), builds a very simple HTML page with basic information about each book in the Calibre library and the Dropbox download link to the book. Requires the Calibre library folder to be located in the Dropbox Public folder.

No longer working since Dropbox removed the Public folder. 

Done in April 2016.
